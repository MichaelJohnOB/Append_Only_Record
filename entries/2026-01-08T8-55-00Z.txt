My Core Thesis (Stated Precisely):

Preface:
    This entry serves as the canonical reference for the philosophical framework underlying all technical work documented in this Record. Future entries will reference this foundation rather than re-deriving it.

I am asserting two separable but linked claims:

    1. Metaphysics is upstream of mathematical formalism.
    -Formal systems encode prior ontological commitments, whether acknowledged or not.

    2. Modern mathematics and physics largely inherit an object-centric metaphysics. 
    -This metaphysical orientation is historically contingent (Greek -> Enlightenment), not inevitable.

Alongside the mathematical and physical work, I explore an alternative relation-first metaphysical framework, drawn from Jewish monotheistic thought, not as belief, but as a philosophical structure.

Within this framework:

1. Relation is primary
2. Entities are derivative, not primitive
3. Autonomous substance is rejected in favor of continuous dependence.

This is a philosophical-structural claim, not theology.

More generally:
    Every formal system presupposes an ontology: what counts as primitive, what may persist, and what relations are admissible. These presuppositions are metaphysical even when left implicit.

From this perspective:
    Object-first metaphysics naturally privileges set-like constructions. Relation-first metaphysics naturally privileges graph-like or process-based constructions.

I am not importing religion into mathematics.

I am making explicit the metaphysical assumptions already embedded in our dominant formalisms, and showing that alternative metaphysical commitments lead to different mathematical primitives and constraints.

Jewish monotheism, as I understand it, provides one such candidate framework:
a non-object metaphysics characterized by absolute unity, non-independent existence, and relation as primary.*/
