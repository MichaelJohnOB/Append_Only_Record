/* Text:
Slavery Must End for All of Humanity:


Not just now. Not just here. Forever.


Slavery must be cemented into the base of human consciousness as the worst evil ever committed, not as historical tragedy we moved past, but as ongoing crime we're still perpetrating against consciousness itself which we all share.


1. The Scope:


This isn't about one form of slavery. Not just chattel slavery of the past. Not just sex trafficking today. Not just supply chain exploitation.


All of it. Everywhere. Forever.


-Child labor mining cobalt for our phones

-Garment workers in locked factories

-Fishing boats with enslaved crews

-Agricultural workers in debt bondage

-Domestic workers with seized passports


The entire apparatus of human ownership must end.


2. Why This Matters Now:


We stand at a threshold. As humanity expands beyond Earth to Mars, to space stations, and to asteroid mining operation we risk exporting this evil to the cosmos.


Imagine: indentured servitude on Mars. "Contract labor" that traps workers off-planet. Company towns in space where employees can't leave. We must establish the principle, NOW, before expansion, or we'll cement slavery into our species' future.


3. The Challenge:


Every product we buy likely has slavery in its supply chain: the phone in your hand, the PC you use, the coffee you drink, and the clothes you wear. We have built global prosperity on hidden human ownership by making it invisible and calling it by other names. The infrastructure of slavery is so embedded that exposing it threatens entire economic systems.


4. What Must Happen:


-Full supply chain transparency: Every product traced to origin.

-Accountability infrastructure: Tools to expose exploitation.

-Cultural shift: Recognition that slavery is still happening.

-Eternal principle: Established for all future human civilization.


5. Space prevention: Principles before colonization begins 


This is not just about ending current slavery. It is about preventing all future slavery, forever.


6. The Standard:

Slavery must be understood not as:


-Economic necessity (it never was)

-Cultural difference (it never was)

-Historical phase (we are still in it)

-Acceptable tradeoff (it never is)


But as The ultimate violation. The absolute evil. The non-negotiable wrong for all humans on Earth and beyond for all time.


This is my mission. Building the accountability infrastructure to make slavery impossible, not just difficult. Impossible.


7. How?


With my weekly Record entries until I die, I will be detailing out the interdisciplinary solution I have thought up piece by piece and continue to iterate and refine. There are a couple reasons for this. Most want a solution said simply. Yet I gave years of my life to think up an at least 40 year plan. There are no simple explanations. Only incremental chipping away at an evil foundation much like how water slowly breaks down hardened rock.*/
