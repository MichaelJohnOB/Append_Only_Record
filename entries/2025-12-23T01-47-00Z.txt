/* Text:
Landauer’s Principle Is an Ethical Law (Disguised as Physics)


1. Opening Claim:


Landauer’s principle is usually taught as a narrow result in information theory and thermodynamics.


This framing hides what it actually is: a constraint on responsibility.



2. The Physical Statement:


Landauer's principle:


-Any logically irreversible operation (erasure) necessarily dissipates heat.


-There is no such thing as “free deletion.”



3. The Structural Translation:


-Erasure != disappearance.


-Erasure = externalized cost.


If information does not persist in the system, it persists as entropy in the environment.



4. Why This Is an Ethical Statement:


Ethics is about where costs go.


Landauer proves: cost cannot be eliminated, only displaced.


A system that erases without witness is a system that hides who pays.



5. Computing Meets Biosphere:


Heat dissipation is not abstract.


It enters:


-data centers


-power grids


-cooling water


-atmospheric load


In a heat-trapping biosphere, “just a bit more entropy” is no longer neutral.



6. The Climate Implication:


Every overwrite, every discarded log, every “stateless” optimization:


-converts memory into heat


-converts accountability into environmental burden


Climate change is not only an energy problem.


It is an erasure problem.



7. Cultural Blind Spot:


Modern computing normalizes:


-overwrite


-deletion


-loss of lineage


This mirrors economic systems that:


-hide labor


-hide extraction


-hide harm



8. The Invariant:


No erasure without consequence.


Physics enforces what ethics has been trying to say for millennia.



9. Closing Line:


Landauer didn’t just limit computation.


He revealed a law civilization keeps trying to violate.*/
