My Core Thesis (Stated Precisely)


I am asserting two separable but linked claims: Metaphysics is upstream of mathematical formalism.


Formal systems encode prior ontological commitments, whether acknowledged or not. Modern mathematics and physics largely inherit an object-centric metaphysics.


This metaphysical orientation is historically contingent (Greek -> Enlightenment), not inevitable. Alongside the mathematical and physical work, I explore an alternative relation-first metaphysical framework, drawn from Jewish monotheistic thought, not as belief, but as a philosophical structure.


In this framework:

1. Relation is primary. 

2. Entities are derivative, not primitive. 

3. Autonomous substance is rejected in favor of continuous dependence. 


This is a philosophical-structural claim, not theology.


More generally:

Every formal system presupposes an ontology: what counts as primitive, what may persist, and what relations are admissible. These presuppositions are metaphysical even when left implicit.


From this perspective:

Object-first metaphysics naturally privileges set-like constructions. Relation-first metaphysics naturally privileges graph-like or process-based constructions.


I am not importing religion into mathematics.


I am making explicit the metaphysical assumptions already embedded in our dominant formalisms, and showing that alternative metaphysical commitments lead to different mathematical primitives and constraints.


Jewish monotheism, as I understand it, provides one such candidate framework:

a non-object metaphysics characterized by absolute unity, non-independent existence, and relation as primary.*/
