Fun Idea: If the universe is computational, can machines “reverse” environmental damage? (With credit to insights from Stephen Wolfram)


If reality emerges from underlying computational rules, then machines deeply coupled to those rules can steer outcomes, but only locally and law-respectfully.



Key points:


1. A computational universe does not allow rewriting physical laws. No machine can erase entropy, violate conservation laws, or export heat for free.


2. What is possible: machines can navigate state space more effectively than natural or human processes, locally reshaping emergent behavior (like life, control systems, or refrigeration already do).


3. Removing Earth’s heat load by “dumping it into space” is not free. Thermodynamics requires work; any claim of negligible cost is just hidden cost elsewhere.


4. The real leverage is not magical cooling, but reducing irreversible heat generation at the source by restructuring energy use, computation, infrastructure, and incentives so entropy isn’t produced unnecessarily.


5. This turns climate change into a systems and ethics problem, not a missing technology problem: costs cannot be eliminated, only displaced.



In short:


A machine aligned with the universe’s computation can’t undo physics, but it can help civilization stop externalizing entropy onto the biosphere in the first place.


So we would have to have a clear map of civilization's structures to calculate possible paths through state space that minimize avoidable entropy production subject to physical, biological, and social constraints.


If you can define a continuous map of civilization’s structures such as resources, labor, energy, and information we aren't just looking at a "picture"; we are looking at a Manifold.


And once we have a manifold, we have Differential Geometry. And I suppose this allows us to apply the same math used in General Relativity and Fluid Dynamics to the "Flow of Ethics" and "Entropy Production."


Modern civilization contains wormhole-like structures: regions that function as entropy and cost sinks, invisibly connected to regions that function as benefit and signal sources. Extraction zones absorb heat, risk, and human cost, while consumption and innovation hubs experience the outflow as clean computation, capital, and comfort.


For example, mineral extraction regions like the eastern Congo act as thermodynamic and human cost sinks, while technology hubs like Palo Alto experience the coupled outflow as low-friction computation and wealth with the connecting structure deliberately obscured.*/
